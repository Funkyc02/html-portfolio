<h3> Remember the Titans </h3>
<p> Very iconic movie for me and my family. Feel good, inspiring, and funny
    movie about a high school football team during the strenuous time of
    integration in schools.
</p>
<h3> The Dark Knight </h3>
<p> An objectively perfect movie with an amazing villain. Heath Ledger
    as the Joker is phenomenal. Batman's theme gives me chills. Christoper 
    Nolan FTW.
</p>
<h3> Interstellar </h3>
<p> I cry everytime I watch this movie, it is a masterpiece. Christopher Nolan
    once again delivers in absolute genius, Hans Zimmer crafts what is arguably
    the greatest soundtrack of all-time.
