<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> My name is Caleb Funk. I am a 20 year old junior at the University of
  Utah studying computer science. Though born right here in Salt Lake City,
  I grew up my whole life in southwestern Connecticut. I love playing and
  watching sports of any kind. In particular, I ran competitive track and
  cross country throughout high school. I am also an avid skiier which 
  largely contributed to my decision to come to the U. In my free time, I
  go to the gym, hike, and play video games with friends. I am working
  towards a career in software engineering.
